**REMEMBER TO INSTALL PYTHON FROM MICROSOFT STORE BEFORE DOWNLOADING**

Discord Status Changer is an open source program that allows you to set custom statuses to automatically cycle through.
R to start cycling.
X to stop.
E to edit statuses.
D to edit delay.
I to change activity status. (Online, DND, Idle.)

**Setup Steps**

- Open Microsoft Store and install Python if not installed already. (3.11+)
- Install and extract the .ZIP file anywheres on your computer.
- Open the folder and run Setup.bat.
- Go to https://discord.com/channels/@me
- Press CTRL, SHIFT, and I at the same time once loaded.
- Go to Application>>Local Storage>>https://discord.com
- Click Filter and type in "token".
- Press the "toggle device toolbar button"
- Once token appears, copy it and remove the quotation marks from it.
- Paste into the prompt.
- Press E to set your statuses. You can set as many statuses as you'd like.
- Press D to set your delay (I recommend 1-5, as discord can ratelimit your requests. Decimal numbers work aswell.)
- Once all set up, simply hit R to start setting your statuses.
